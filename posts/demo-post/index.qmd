This is a post with executable code.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

$$
Y \sim \text{N}(\mu, \sigma)
$$ {#eq-one}

we love a simple equation like @eq-one

let's have a plot

```{r}
set.seed(5992)
x <- runif(42, -2, 2)
y <- rnorm(42, 5 + 2.4 * x, 2.3)

plot(x, y)

```

Here are two figures I made beforehand:

```{r tarplot}
library(targets)
tar_load(plot_add)
tar_load(plot_mult)
plot_add
```

I want to know if you can see these figures!
